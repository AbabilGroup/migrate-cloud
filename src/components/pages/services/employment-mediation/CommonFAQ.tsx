                What Are Your Obligations Towards a Foreign Worker?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Once a work permit is obtained for a foreign worker, it is
                necessary to provide accommodation and meals upon their arrival.
                The accommodation should meet basic living standards. If food
                cannot be provided, a food allowance must be paid to the worker.
                Additionally, you are obligated to register the worker for
                pension and health insurance, just as you would for any local
                employee.
