          What Does the Worker Assignment Service Include?
        </h2>

        <p className="border-l-2 border-l-black pl-5 font-bold">
          This service provides flexibility in workforce management while
          reducing administrative burdens. It grants access to specialized
          talent from abroad without the complexities of direct recruitment.
        </p>

        <p>
          We simplify temporary employment by drafting formal Employment
          Contracts and assigning workers to client companies under agreed
          terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our services extend beyond employment by managing administrative tasks
          such as pension and health insurance applications, salary
          calculations, and benefits processing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Workers are placed in client companies under agreed conditions while
          we assume the official role of the employer.
        </p>

        <p>
          By choosing our services, companies benefit from a streamlined process
          that resolves bureaucratic challenges, ensures legal compliance, and
          enhances administrative efficiency. This allows businesses to focus on
          their core operations.
