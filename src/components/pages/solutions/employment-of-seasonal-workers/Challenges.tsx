            Challenges in Finding Seasonal Workers
          </h2>

          <p className="border-l-2 border-l-black pl-5 font-bold">
            The problem of finding seasonal workers in Croatia, especially in
            industries such as tourism, catering, agriculture, and construction,
            is multifaceted and often represents a significant challenge for
            employers.
          </p>

          <p>
            The hospitality industry is more subject to seasonal changes than
            ever before, compared to any other sphere of activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of our clients during the first quarter cannot accurately
            predict the number and need for external or foreign workers during
            the high season.
          </p>
          <p>
            The situation in which most resorts, hotels, and restaurants make
            last-minute hiring decisions results in a sudden increase in demand
            for workers. This further results in the marketâ€™s unwillingness to
            meet that demand immediately. Namely, from the moment of signing the
            contract with the Employment Agency, it takes a month or even two
            until the foreign workers arrive at their workplace. Finding
            workers, testing qualifications, interviewing, paperwork and similar
            processes take up most of that time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, we offer you a solution that eliminates the risks of long
            waits and delays in the arrival of workers: outsourcing of labor.
