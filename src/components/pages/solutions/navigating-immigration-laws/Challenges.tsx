            Challenges of Immigration Compliance
          </h2>

          <p className="border-l-2 border-l-black pl-5 font-bold">
            One of the biggest challenges companies encounter when hiring
            foreign professionals is navigating the intricate immigration laws,
            which are designed to safeguard the local labor market while also
            addressing economic workforce demands.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ensuring compliance with immigration regulations can be complex, as
            businesses must adhere to strict legal requirements governing the
            employment of international workers. Employers are obligated to meet
            tax and social security regulations, as well as specific conditions,
            such as maintaining full-time employment for local or EU nationals
            for a designated period. The process also involves obtaining work
            and residence permits, along with adhering to policies for hiring
            talent from non-EU countries.
